# CSCI544: Homework Assignment No.4

You need put the three data on `./data`
You need to create a folder `./save` to save the checkpoint and the result.

## Task 1: Simple Bidirectional LSTM model

Run the following code in cmd:

```
python task1.py
```

The checkpoint will be saved in `save/blstm1.pt`, the dev and test result will be saved in `save/dev1.out` and `save/test1.out`.

## Task 2: Using GloVe word embeddings

Run the following code in cmd:

```
python task2.py
```

The checkpoint will be saved in `save/blstm2.pt`, the dev and test result will be saved in `save/dev2.out` and `save/test2.out`.

## Task 3: LSTM + CRF

```
python task3.py 
```

The checkpoint will be saved in `save/blstm3.pt`, the dev and test result will be saved in `save/dev3.out` and `save/test3.out`.
